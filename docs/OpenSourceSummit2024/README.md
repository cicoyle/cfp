# Standardizing Errors: A Practical Guide with Dapr

Embark on a journey to demystify the process of standardizing errors 
in software development. In this session, explore the broader landscape 
of error standardization and gain practical insights into the implementation 
of standardized errors using the gRPC Richer Error Model and Google API Errors 
Model. The discussion centers around the creation of a dedicated dapr/kit 
package, employing the builder pattern for constructing standardized errors 
within the Dapr open-source project. Delve into the current state of 
standardization efforts in Dapr, offering valuable lessons applicable beyond 
Dapr, and conclude with an inclusive call to action for the community to 
contribute to the error standardization efforts in the Dapr open-source project.
